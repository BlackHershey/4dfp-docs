4dfp docs

This website is intended to provide up-to-date documentation on Avi Snyderâ€™s 4dfp suite of tools. Currently, it contains usage information for the tools, as well as explanations of the inputs, outputs, and processing steps for BOLD preprocessing scripts. It is a work in progress, with plans to add more worked examples and detailed documentation of additional scripts in the near future. In addition, we plan to pair it with a searchable community discussion site.

This work was performed by Dr. Avi Snyder, Haley Acevedo and Jon Koller and generously supported by the NIL, NIAC, McDonnell Center for Systems Neuroscience and the Psychiatry, Radiology, Neurology and Psychological and Brain Sciences Departments at WU.
